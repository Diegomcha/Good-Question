Once upon a time there existed a person called (Read your name here, please) who liked
to hang out with friends. Nevertheless bravery was never one of the strenghts of our poor little hero
(It always is nice to say someone was a hero despite it beeing it or not, remember, we need audience)

The thing is, their friends knew that and used it to make jokes on him. That was the 
reason why at the begining it was hard to believe his the best friend was trapped in an enchanted Mansion, 
it wasn't until he heard the screams that the feeling of fooled dissapeared from our hero.

It took him some time for deciding, but after watching the reflection of the bff hoody that he was wearing, he realised 
that the life of his friend was in his hands. Good Luck!
