You are spending time together with your friends when one of them proposes 
exploring an abandoned house notorious due to paranormal activity. Only you agreed
to go since you´re concerned something bad may happen. Once you arrive at the 
house you get scared and decide to stay outside while your friend goes inside to 
look around.

For a while nothing strange happens, when suddenly your friend yells “HELP”. At 
first you think he is trying to prank you, but a couple minutes pass and he is 
nowhere to be seen, which makes you start worrying. Then you spot two red eyes 
staring at you through what is left of the top window of the building. That is 
when you decide to call the police and your friends, who understandably think you 
are joking so they do not offer any help. The only option left is going in there 
to save him yourself, will you overcome your fear to help your best friend?

You decide to get inside to help your friend and your adventure starts.
